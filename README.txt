1.My Running Requirement
  * Eclipse for java developer
  * JDK 1.8
  * JUnit 4(Open Eclipse and select Java Build Path->Libraries->Add Library->Junit 4)
  
2.Open Eclipse and import the project

3.Because "nor is the use of any frameworks", If don't use JUnit to test, just run Test.java to test

4.MVC Architecture

5.Because UI is not required, I don't use Android Studio and MVP pattern to do it
