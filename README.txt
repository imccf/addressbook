1.My Running Requirement
  * Eclipse for java developer
  * JDK 1.8
  * JUnit 4(Open Eclipse and select Java Build Path->Libraries->Add Library->Junit 4)
  
2.Open Eclipse and import the project

3.Because "nor is the use of any frameworks", If don't use JUnit to test, just run Test.java to test

4.MVC Architecture

5.Because UI is not required, I don't use Android Studio and MVP pattern to do it

6.For "get a unique contact" feature, user can call printUniqueAllContacts(int index) function to get data,
  the param index is similar with "Index" of a database. so We can print same unique contact across multiple address books.

7.For "get a unique contact" feature, user also can call printUniqueAllContactsByID(String id) function to get data,
  the param id is same as unique ID, so We can print same unique contact across multiple address books with same ID.
